Home automation - Hassio setup on Raspberry Pi 3

This home automation have a couple of automations, basically with conditions that enable triggering
between sunset and sunrise or triggering at sunset and enabled for a couple of hours. Currently it uses
telldus live and telldus switches but telldus live may be changed to tellstick to avoid the dependency
to telldus live and internet.

Currently there are 13 switches that  controll lamps of different types such as
incandescent, led and hallogen lamps and two temperature and humidity sensors. 
The home automations also track two mobile phones for proximity to home to turn on a halogen floodlight
during the dark hours when the phones enter the home zone.
